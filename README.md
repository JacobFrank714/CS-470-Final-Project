# CS-470-Final-Project

## Database-Info

This is the code to recreate the database

We all had problems run the sql scripts in the workbench so you might need to run them in the mysql command line interface with the \. command and then the file path of the script with a space between like: "\. file/path/to/script.sql"

### Database creation

Go to Database_Info and run the J3DK-DatabaseScript.sql file to create the database first. There are procedures that will not be used yet and there is one we are still working the kinks out of but the database will deploy without error.

### Populate database

Go to Database_Info and run the TestDataPopulation.sql file to populate the data base with our test data just to verify it works. We will make more entries by the time for the final submition.
